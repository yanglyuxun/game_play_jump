# Wechat Jump Game Reinforcement Learning

This is a Q learning inplement on Wechat Jump Game. 


## Goal

The purpose is not for solving this specific game. Acturally, Q learning may not be the most efficient way for this game. It is just my experiment of letting the computer to learn a game from amages directly, without "rule teaching". If you only want to solve this game, there are some pixel analysis which can give much more accurate results. 


## Summary

I used a CNN for training. See the model structure below.

The input is the pixel matrix of the useful area, and the output is the Q function value for different actions. The action is the duration length of the press (which is used to control the jump distance in the game). The press time is between 300-1200 ms, and is descreted into 15 intervals.

The input data is produced from my Android phone with ABD tool. A memory list is used for playback, and each time a batch is fed to the model. 

The data producing is way too slow. So a pixel masking tool is used to generate different rewards to actions for each picture. In theory, it is similar to the data produced by more steps without that additional generation. But it is still very slow.

## Result

See Memory_checker.ipynb

After training 2 nights, only ~10000 steps, the "die rate" is 0.039 in the last memory list. The best score is only 175 (I cannot achieve this score by hands, but many of my friends can). With more training, the model is expected to do better. (But I won't do that, since I want to keep my cell phone's life span...)
